# Gravity Falls: The Pinball Game

*"Welcome to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!"*

## Requirements

This project requires the Mission Pinball Framework 0.52 and can be simulated using the MPF virtual machine and MPF monitor interface. Playing in the real world requires a physical pinball machine (configuration coming soon). Please note "CURRENTLY WORKING!" simply means no obvious errors with the code - none of it has been tested against a real machine as yet.

## Main Gameplay

**Spoiler Warning:**
*In recreating the full experience of* Gravity Falls *as a pinball game, this game includes significant characters and story events from the original television show.*

### Pick a Character

At the start of gameplay, the player can pick from one of four characters to play as: Dipper, Mabel, Soos, or Wendy. Each character confers different bonuses for the End of Ball Bonus. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Dipper Pines**

Every spelling of "BILL" adds 10,000 to the End of Ball Bonus. (NOT YET STARTED)

* **Mabel Pines**

Every ramp shot adds 1,000 to the End of Ball Bonus. (NOT YET STARTED)

* **Soos Ramirez**

Every spelling of "STAN" adds 10,000 to the End of Ball Bonus. (NOT YET STARTED)

* **Wendy Corduroy**

Every spelling of "TOTEM" adds 15,000 to the End of Ball Bonus. (NOT YET STARTED)

### Scene Ladders

The picking of a character (above) determines which of four scene ladders is available at the start of the game. The completion of a scene ladder then causes another randomly selected ladder to become available. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

(MOSTLY WORKING! - Need to add scoring)

#### Scary-oke ####

(NOT YET STARTED)

### Zodiac Missions

In a manner similar to the much-loved *The Addam's Family* pinball machine of yesteryear, the base challenge of the game is to work your way through all 10 different missions presented on the playfield zodiac. To activate a mission, the player must first spell "STAN" using those targets, which activates a 20 second window during which access to the lit Mystery Shack is granted. Shoot the Mystery Shack to light the Zodiac saucer. Once the lit Zodiac saucer is hit, the mode begins. The *Question Mark* mode is always lit first. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Question Mark/Soos Ramirez (Soos and the Real Girl)**

Upon starting, the player has 16 seconds to shoot the lit Mystery Shack ramp to help Soos talk to a girl. Achieving this starts the mode proper, where the player has 20 seconds to help Soos fix things, during which every shot and target is worth 200,000 points. On top of this, every shot on the Portal target increases a bonus by 50,000 points. These bonus points are awarded as part of the End of Ball Bonus. The mode ends when the timer runs out. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Bag of Ice/Wendy Corduroy (Roadside Attraction)**

When the mode starts the player has a 20 second timer. During this time all shots/targets are worth 250,000 points and the player starts with a 1,000,000 point bonus. These points are all awarded as part of the End of Ball Bonus. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Fez Symbol/Stan Pines (The Stanchurian Candidate)**

When the mode begins a hurry up starts. Scoring starts at 15,000,000 and tumbles downwards over 20 seconds. To inflate Stan's ego and score the hurry up points, the player must hit the Portal target. The mode ends when the timer runs out (confering whatever points remain at that time), or when the player hits the Portal target. If the player hits the Portal target, in addition to the hurry up points, a 2-ball multiball is started. The multiball ends when a ball drains. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Pine Tree/Dipper Pines (Double Dipper)**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **5-pointed Star/Gideon Gleeful (Gideon Rises)**

To begin with, the player has 20 seconds to shoot the lit Tent of Telepathy saucer. Making this shot enhances the three bumpers, lighting each one, so that a hit on a lit bumper scores 100,000 points. After four hits on an individual bumper, 3,000,000 points are awarded and the bumper is unlit and reverts to regular scoring. Once the timer runs out, or all three lit bumpers are each hit four times, the mode ends. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **6-fingered Hand/Ford Pines (Not What He Seems)**

When the mode starts the player has 20 second to shoot for the lit Bunker. If they achieve this, this starts a 2-ball multiball. While the multiball is active a shot on the lit Bunker or lit Mystery Shack shots score 5 million points. Any additional shots to the lit Bunker or Mystery Shack result in a further 1,000,000 points up to a total of 10,000,000 points for a complete total of 15,000,000 points (after that point the shots are no longer lit). The multiball ends when a ball drains. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Llama/Pacifica Northwest (Northwest Mansion Noir)**

At the start of the mode, the player has 20 seconds to shoot the lit Trembley's Cove shot. After this, for 20 seconds the bumpers are worth 30,000 points when lit, and 10,000 when unlit. Once the timer runs out, the mode comes to an end. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Shooting Star/Mabel Pines (The Hand that Rocks the Mabel)**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Broken Heart/Robbie Valentino (The Love God)**

A 11 second timer begins, with the player having to shoot the lit Watertower ramp in an attempt to gain Wendy's attention. With this hit the player has 20 seconds to shoot three lit shots to graffiti the town: the Watertower ramp, the Mystery Shack ramp, and Trembley's Cove shot. The three shots can be done in any order, with 5,000,000 points for the first, 10,000,000 for the second, and 15,000,000 for the third. Once the timer runs out or all three shots are made, the mode ends. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Glasses/Old Man McGucket (Society of the Blind Eye)**

When the mode begins the player has 20 seconds to help McGucket repair his laptop by making three lit shots: the Tent of Telepathy saucer, the Extra Ball saucer, and the Zodiac saucer. Like The Love God mode, all three shots can be done in order and confer 5,000,000 points for the first, 10,000,000 for the second, and 15,000,000 for the third. Again, once the timer runs out or all three shots are made, the mode ends. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

### Weirdmageddon

The Weirdmageddon mode only becomes available once all 10 Zodiac missions have been attempted, lighting the character of Bill Cypher in the centre of the zodiac. Like the previous missions, the player must spell "STAN", shoot the Mystery Shack, and hit the lit Zodiac saucer to activate the mode. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

(THE REST OF MODE NOT YET STARTED)

* **Weirdmageddon 2: Escape from Reality**

* **Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back the Falls**

* **Weirdmageddon 4: Somewhere in the Woods**

### Time Baby Missions

Starting with reaching the 3x Baby bonus, and thereafter every 3x after that (ie. 6x & 9x), the player is assigned a ramdomly selected Time Baby mission from the three below. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Globnar**

The player has to help Blendin pick up the anachronistic things left around Gravity Falls by hitting six shots in a certain order. These shots are the Watertower ramp (1,000,000 points), Trembley's Cove (1,500,000 points), the Zodiac saucer (2,000,000 points), Tent of Telepathy sacuer (2,500,000 points), the Mystery Shack ramp (3,000,000 points), and the Extra Ball saucer (5,000,000 points). (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **The Inconveniencing**

The player has 35 seconds to shoot six different lit shots and collect the hurry up which starts at 15 million points. The shots, which can be completed in any order, are: the Portal target, the Tent of Telepathy saucer, the Watertower ramp, the Zodiac saucer, Trembley's Cove, and the Mystery Shack ramp. When all six shots are completed, the hurry up is awarded. The mode end when either the six shots are completed or the timer runs out (conferring whatever points remain in the hurry up). (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Land Before Swine**

The player has 25 seconds to hit as many of the six lit targets as possible. The lit targets are the Mystery shot, Trembley's Cove, the Zodiac saucer, the "S" in STAN, the "O" in TOTEM, and the second "L" in BILL. (MOSTLY WORKING! - Need to add scoring)

Once all three missions have been attempted, a new bonus mission begins. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Blendin's Game**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future**

This (NOT YET STARTED)

## Additional Gameplay

### 618

If the player reaches 618 hits on the jets, the 618 mode is activated. After hitting the Mystery shot, this is a 6-ball multiball on a 1 minute timer where the player can score 800,000 points per Tent of Telepathy or Mystery Shack VUK shot, 80,000 per ramp shot, and 8,000 per the Zodiac saucer, Extra Ball saucer, and Trembley's Cove shots. (MOSTLY WORKING!)

### The Golf War

(NOT YET STARTED)

### Headhunters

(NOT YET STARTED)

### It is Unseen

Spelling the word "BILL" lights up the Society shot. The player has 23 seconds to shot the lit shot. This will knock down one of 3 drop targets. After 3 times through, the knocking down of the third target will activate the magnasaves. (MOSTLY WORKING! - Except for activation and later disabling of magnasaves.)

### Into the Bunker

Shooting ramp shots (Watertower, Mystery Shack) adds letters to eventually spell "GRAVITY FALLS" (12 ramp shots in total) across the bottom of the screen. When this is completely spelt, it opens up the bunker. The player has 20 seconds to shot for the bunker and if they manage the shot then 1 ball is locked towards a 3-ball multiball. If they lock the ball or the timer runs out, the ramp count resets so they can try again. Once two balls are locked in the bunker, ramp shots no longer confer letters (at least until after the 3-ball multiball when it resets). (MOSTLY WORKING! - Except for letters are not remaining on screen at all times and continue to appear after they should be disabled.)

(THE REST OF MODE NOT YET STARTED)

### Nearly Almost Dead But Not Quite!

Lights the Mystery shot. One the shot has been achieved this lights the Tombstone, letting the player know that they now have an extra ball that will play upon thier last ball draining. (MOSTLY WORKING! - Except for trigger event for starting this mode)

### The Time Traveler's Pig

(NOT YET STARTED)

### TOTEM Pole

Spelling the word "TOTEM" confers one step on the Totem Pole (Beaver 2 -> Beaver 1 -> Bird 2 -> Bird 1). Each time all four steps are completed it awards one of the four awards in the following order below. Once the forth award is awarded it resets to allow the four awards to be collected again. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **1: Irrational Treasure (Beaver 2)**

Player awarded 100,000 points. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **2: A Tale of Two Stans (Beaver 1)**

Triggers a timed mode where for 30 seconds all regular shots and targets are worth double their normal value. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **3: Bottomless Pit! (Bird 2)**

Light the Extra Ball saucer. (MOSTLY WORKING! - Awarding of extra ball not yet added.)

* **4: Dreamscaperers (Bird 1)**

Starts a quick 2-ball multiball. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **5: Dungeons, Dungeons and More Dungeons**

Once all for awards are achieved, each further completion of the Totem Pole earns the player 1,000,000 points. The Totem Pole awards can be reset by completing the Weirdmageddon mode. (MOSTLY WORKING! - Reset not yet added.)
