# Gravity Falls: The Pinball Game

*"Welcome to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!"*

## Requirements

This project requires the Mission Pinball Framework 0.50 and can be simulated using the MPF virtual machine and MPF monitor interface. Playing in the real world requires pinball machine (configuration coming soon).

## Main Gameplay

**Spoiler Warning:**
*In recreating the full experience of* Gravity Falls *as a pinball game, this game includes significant characters and story events from the original television show.*

### Pick a Character

At the start of gameplay, the player can pick from one of four characters to play as: Dipper, Mabel, Soos, or Wendy. Each character confers different bonuses for the End of Ball Bonus. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Dipper Pines**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Mabel Pines**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Soos Ramirez**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Wendy Corduroy**

(NOT YET STARTED)

### Zodiac Missions

In a manner similar to the much-loved *The Addam's Family* pinball machine of yesteryear, the base challenge of the game is to work your way through all 10 different missions presented on the playfield zodiac (mission names are taken from episode titles). To activate a mission, the player must first spell "STAN" using those targets, which activates a 20 second window during which access to the lit Mystery Shack is granted. Shoot the Mystery Shack to light the Zodiac saucer. Once the lit Zodiac saucer is hit, the mode begins. The *Question Mark* mode is always lit first. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Question Mark (Soos and the Real Girl)**

Upon starting, the player has 16 seconds to shoot the lit Mystery Shack ramp to help Soos talk to a girl. Achieving this starts the mode proper, where the player has 20 seconds to help Soos fix things, during which every shot and target is worth 200,000 points. On top of this, every shot on the Portal target increases the shot/target bonus by 50,000 points. These points are awarded as part of the End of Ball Bonus. The mode ends when the timer runs out. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Bag of Ice (Roadside Attraction)**

(IN PROGRESS)

* **Fez Symbol (The Stanchurian Candidate)**

When the mode begins a hurry up starts. Scoring starts at 15 million and tumbles downwards over 20 seconds. To inflate Stan's ego and score the hurry up points, the player must hit the Portal target. The mode ends when the timer runs out (confering whatever points remain at that time), or when the player hits the Portal target. If the player hits the Portal target, in addition to the hurry up points, a two-ball multiball is started. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Pine Tree (Double Dipper)**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **5-pointed Star (Gideon Rises)**

To begin with, the player has 20 seconds to shoot the lit Tent of Telepathy saucer. Making this shot enhances the three bumpers, lighting each one, so that a hit on a lit bumper scores 100,000 points. After four hits on an individual bumper, 3 million points are awarded and the bumper is unlit and reverts to regular scoring. Once the timer runs out, or all three lit bumpers are each hit four times, the mode ends. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **6-fingered Hand (Not What He Seems)**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Llama (Northwest Mansion Noir)**

At the start of the mode, the player has 20 seconds to shoot the lit Trembley's Cove shot. After this, for 20 seconds the bumpers are worth 30,000 points when lit, and 10,000 when unlit. Once the timer runs out, the mode comes to an end. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Shooting Star (The Hand that Rocked the Mabel)**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **Broken Heart (The Love God)**

A 11 second timer begins, with the player having to shoot the lit Watertower ramp in an attempt to gain Wendy's attention. With this hit the player has 20 seconds to shoot three lit shots to graffiti the town: the Watertower ramp, the Mystery Shack ramp, and Trembley's Cove shot. The three shots can be done in any order, with 5 million points for the first, 10 million for the second, and 15 million for the third. Once the timer runs out or all three shots are made, the mode ends. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **Glasses (Society of the Blind Eye)**

When the mode begins the player has 20 seconds to help McGucket repair his laptop by making three lit shots: the Tent of Telepathy saucer, the Extra Ball saucer, and the Zodiac saucer. Like The Love God mode, all three shots can be done in order and confer 5 million points for the first, 10 million for the second, and 15 million for the third. Again, once the timer runs out or all three shots are made, the mode ends. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

### Weirdmageddon

The Weirdmageddon mode only becomes available once all 10 Zodiac missions have been attempted, lighting the character of Bill Cypher in the centre of the zodiac. Like the previous missions, the player must spell "STAN", shoot the Mystery Shack, and hit the lit Zodiac saucer to activate the mode. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

(THE REST OF MODE NOT YET STARTED)

## Side Missions

## Additional Gameplay

### Time Baby Missions

Starting with reaching the 5x Baby bonus, and thereafter every 10x after that (ie. 15x & 25x), the player is assigned a ramdomly selected Time Baby mission from the three below. (MOSTLY WORKING! - Not sure what to do after all three modes are attempted.)

* **Globnar**

(NOT YET STARTED)

* **The Inconveniencing**

The player has 35 seconds to shot six different lit shots and collect the hurry up which starts at 15 million points: the Portal target, the Tent of Telepathy saucer, the Watertower ramp, the Zodiac saucer, the Trembley's Cove shot, and the Mystery Shack ramp. When all six shots are completed, the hurry up is awarded. (CURRENTLY WORKING!)

* **The Land Before Swine**

(NOT YET STARTED)
