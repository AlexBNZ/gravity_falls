# Gravity Falls: The Pinball Game

*"Welcome to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!"*

## Requirements

This project requires the Mission Pinball Framework 0.50 and can be simulated using the MPF virtual machine and MPF monitor interface. Playing in the real world requires pinball machine (configuration coming soon).

## Main Gameplay

**Spoiler Warning:**
*In recreating the full experience of* Gravity Falls *as a pinball game, this game includes significant characters and story events from the original television show.*

### Zodiac Missions

In a manner similar to the much-loved *The Addam's Family* pinball machine of yesteryear, the base challenge of the game is to work your way through all 10 different missions presented on the playfield zodiac. To activate a mission, the player must first spell "STAN" using those targets, which activates a 20 second window during which access to the Mystery Shack is granted. Shoot the Mystery Shack to light the Zodiac saucer. Once the lit Zodiac saucer is hit, the mode begins. The *Question Mark* mode is always lit first.

* **Question Mark**
* **Bag of Ice**
* **Fez Symbol**
* **Pine Tree**
* **5-pointed Star**
* **6-fingered Hand**

* **Shooting Star**
* **Broken Heart**
* **Glasses**

### Weirdmageddon

The Weirdmageddon mode only becomes available once all 10 Zodiac missions have been attempted, lighting the character of Bill Cypher in the centre of the zodiac. Like the previous missions, the player must spell "STAN", shoot the Mystery Shack, and hit the lit Zodiac saucer to activate the mode.
